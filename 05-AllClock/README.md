## 🌟 Overview
This **All-in-One Clock App** combines both a **Digital Clock** and an **Analog Clock** with an additional **Stopwatch** feature. It displays the current time and date, allowing users to switch between **12-hour** and **24-hour** formats. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it provides a fully interactive experience with sleek animations.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Real-time clock** with both digital and analog displays 🕰  
- ✅ **12-hour / 24-hour toggle** to switch formats seamlessly 🔄  
- ✅ **Displays current date** in a user-friendly format 📅  
- ✅ **Stopwatch feature** with start, stop, and reset buttons ⏱  
- ✅ **Smooth animations** for the clock hands and transitions ✨  
- ✅ **Accurate time tracking** using JavaScript’s `setInterval()` 🕒  
- ✅ **Well-structured and optimized code** for easy maintenance 🛠️  

## 💡 How It Works
1️⃣ **Clock updates automatically** every second to display current time 🕐  
2️⃣ **Click the “Change 12/24 Hour Format” button** to switch between time formats ⏳🔄  
3️⃣ **Date is displayed dynamically** and updates every day 📅  
4️⃣ **Stylish animations & transitions** enhance the user experience 🎨  
5️⃣ **Analog clock updates smoothly** with rotating hands for accurate time tracking ⏱  
6️⃣ **Stopwatch feature** lets users start, stop, and reset with button controls ⏰  

## ⚡ JavaScript Magic Behind the Scenes
- `updateClock()` → Fetches current time and updates the display in real-time  
- `setInterval(updateClock, 1000)` → Ensures clock updates every second  
- `is24HourFormat` → Controls 12-hour or 24-hour mode switching  
- `padStart(2, '0')` → Ensures time values always appear in `00` format  
- `toLocaleDateString()` → Formats and displays the current date dynamically  
- `Event Listener` → Detects user clicks to toggle time formats  
- **Stopwatch Functions**: Tracks time with **10ms precision** using `setInterval`
