## 🚀 Welcome to the Weather App!

### 🌟 Developed by: Shiva Bhusal
### 🎯 Challenge: 30-Day Coding Challenge (Day 7 ✅ Successfully Completed!)

## 🌟 Overview

The **Weather App** allows users to get real-time weather information for any city. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this app fetches weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays the temperature, weather description, and more in a sleek, modern UI.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Search by city name** to get real-time weather data 🌍  
- ✅ **Displays current weather**, temperature, and weather conditions 🌤️  
- ✅ **Responsive design** for all screen sizes 📱💻  
- ✅ **Displays weather icon** based on current weather condition 🌈  
- ✅ **Min/Max temperature** for better weather planning 🌡️  
- ✅ **Error handling** if city is not found ❌

## 💡 How It Works

1️⃣ **Enter the city name** in the input field or press Enter to search 📝  
2️⃣ **Fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API** to get current weather details 🌤️  
3️⃣ **Displays the city name, weather description**, temperature, and min/max temperatures 🌡️  
4️⃣ **Error message displayed** if the city is invalid or not found ❌  
5️⃣ **Fully responsive layout** makes it accessible on any device 📱💻

## ⚡ JavaScript Magic Behind the Scenes

- `fetch(url)` → Fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API for the city 🏙️  
- `then((data) => {...})` → Handles the API response and displays data 🖥️  
- `result.innerHTML` → Dynamically updates the UI with weather data 🌦️  
- `cityRef.value = "";` → Clears the input field after a search 🧹  
- `catch(() => {...})` → Handles errors if city is not found 🚫
