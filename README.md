# 🚀 30 Days - 30 Projects Challenge | The Ultimate Web Dev Sprint!

Welcome to my **30 Days - 30 Projects Challenge!** 🎯

In the next 30 days, I will be building and uploading a new project every single day using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal? To sharpen my skills, explore creative ideas, and push myself to master front-end development.

## 📌 Why This Challenge?
✅ **Practice makes perfect** – Coding every day will help me write cleaner, more efficient code.  
✅ **Real-world experience** – By the end of this, I'll have 30 mini-projects that showcase my skills.  
✅ **Consistency is key** – Building daily will make JavaScript feel like second nature.
