🚀 30 Days - 30 Projects Challenge | The Ultimate Web Dev Sprint!

Welcome to my 30 Days - 30 Projects Challenge! 🎯
In the next 30 days, I will be building and uploading a new project every single day using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal? To sharpen my skills, explore creative ideas, and push myself to master front-end development.

📌 Why This Challenge?
🔥 Practice makes perfect – Coding every day will help me write cleaner, more efficient code.
💡 Real-world experience – By the end of this, I'll have 30 mini-projects that showcase my skills.
🚀 Consistency is key – Building daily will make JavaScript feel like second nature.
