## 🌟 **Overview**
This **interactive and intuitive** Calculator App is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, it allows users to perform calculations smoothly, with support for essential operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## ✨ **Features**
- ✅ **Basic operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and more!  
- ✅ **Clean and responsive UI** for a seamless experience  
- ✅ **Keyboard support**: Perform calculations with both mouse clicks and physical keyboard  
- ✅ **Automatic reset after calculation** for an efficient workflow  
- ✅ **Handle invalid inputs** with helpful alerts  
- ✅ **Simple and smooth design** that adapts to all screen sizes  

## 💡 **How It Works**
1️⃣ **Click any button** (numbers or operators) to input values.  
2️⃣ **Press `Enter`** to calculate the result, similar to the equal (`=`) button.  
3️⃣ **Press `C`** to clear the display and reset the calculator.  
4️⃣ **Error handling**: Invalid inputs trigger alerts to guide the user.  
5️⃣ **Dynamic and responsive** design works on all devices.

## ⚡ **JavaScript Magic Behind the Scenes**
- 🚀 **`handleNumber()`** → Adds numbers to the display and manages input.  
- 💾 **`handleOperator()`** → Handles operators and manages the calculation process.  
- 🔄 **`calculate()`** → Performs the arithmetic calculation based on the current input and operator.  
- 🎯 **Key Event Handling** → Handles both button clicks and keyboard input for a smooth user experience.

## 🔥 **Why You'll Love This App**
- **Simple but powerful UI** 💡
