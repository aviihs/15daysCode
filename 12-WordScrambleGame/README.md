## 🌟 Overview
This **Text Scrambler** is an interactive project that takes a given word, scrambles its letters randomly, and challenges the user to guess the original word. 
Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project enhances logical thinking and JavaScript skills, especially in **string manipulation, event handling, and timers**.
