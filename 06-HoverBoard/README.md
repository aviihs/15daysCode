---

## 🚀 Welcome to the Hoverboard Project!
---
### 🌟 Developed by: Shiva Bhusal
### 🎯 Challenge: 30-Day Coding Challenge (Day 6 ✅ Successfully Completed!)

## 🌟 Overview
---
The **Hoverboard** project is a visually interactive grid animation where squares change colors dynamically when hovered over. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project provides a fun and engaging user experience with smooth transitions.

## ✨ Features
---
- ✅ **Grid-based interactive hover effect** 🎨  
- ✅ **Smooth transition animations** for a seamless experience 🔄  
- ✅ **Randomized color effects** on hover 🌈  
- ✅ **Fast and lightweight** for optimal performance ⚡  
- ✅ **Modern UI with clean and minimal design** 🖌  
- ✅ **JavaScript-powered dynamic color changes** 🖥  


## 💡 How It Works
---
1️⃣ **A grid of squares is generated dynamically using JavaScript** 🟦  
2️⃣ **Hovering over a square changes its color randomly** ✨  
3️⃣ **Smooth transition effects make interactions visually appealing** 🎭  
4️⃣ **Mouse-out restores the square to its original state** 🔄  
5️⃣ **Fully responsive design ensures great user experience on any device** 📱💻  


## ⚡ JavaScript Magic Behind the Scenes
---
- `document.createElement('div')` → Dynamically creates square elements  
- `square.addEventListener('mouseover', () => setColor(square))` → Triggers color change on hover  
- `square.addEventListener('mouseout', () => removeColor(square))` → Resets color when the mouse leaves  
- `getRandomColor()` → Picks a random color from the predefined array  
- `transition: 3s ease` → Controls smooth fade-out effect
